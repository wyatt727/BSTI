# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the remaining action items from the `implementation.md` plan.

## Progress Reporting (Priority: Medium)

- [x] Created the `bsti_nessus/utils/progress.py` module:
  - Implemented the `ProgressTracker` class for individual operations with ETA calculation
  - Created the `NestedProgress` class for multi-stage operations with weighted progress tracking
  - Added context managers and convenience functions (`progress_bar` and `progress_map`)
  - Implemented graceful fallback when `tqdm` is not available

- [x] Created comprehensive unit tests in `bsti_nessus/tests/unit/utils/test_progress.py`:
  - Tests for all `ProgressTracker` methods
  - Tests for all `NestedProgress` methods
  - Tests for context managers and utility functions

## Parallel Processing (Priority: Low)

- [x] Created the `bsti_nessus/utils/parallel.py` module:
  - Implemented the `ThreadPool` class for I/O-bound operations
  - Implemented the `ProcessPool` class for CPU-bound operations
  - Added `chunk_items` function for optimal load distribution
  - Created a convenient `parallel_map` utility function
  - Integrated with the progress reporting module

- [x] Created comprehensive unit tests in `bsti_nessus/tests/unit/utils/test_parallel.py`:
  - Tests for all pool classes and methods
  - Tests for the chunking functionality
  - Integration tests for real parallel execution

## Packaging and Distribution (Priority: Medium)

- [x] Created setup files:
  - `setup.py` with dynamic version and dependency extraction
  - Configured console script entry points
  - Set up package metadata and classifiers

- [x] Created installation scripts:
  - `install.sh` for Linux/macOS with interactive virtual environment setup
  - `install.bat` for Windows with similar functionality

- [x] Updated `requirements.txt` with new dependencies:
  - Added the `rich` library for enhanced CLI output
  - Added test dependencies including `pytest-mock`

- [x] Created unit tests for setup script:
  - `bsti_nessus/tests/unit/test_setup.py` for testing setup.py functions

## CI/CD Pipeline (Priority: Low)

- [x] Created GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Implemented testing on multiple Python versions and operating systems
  - Added code coverage reporting
  - Configured automated build process
  - Set up release deployment when tags are pushed

## Documentation

- [x] Updated documentation:
  - Enhanced README.md with information about new features
  - Added examples for using progress reporting and parallel processing
  - Updated installation instructions to use new scripts
  - Added development section with testing instructions

## Next Steps

To fully integrate these new modules into the application:

1. Modify the core conversion and upload logic to use parallel processing
2. Add progress tracking to all long-running operations
3. Update the CLI interface to add the new command-line options
4. Add integration tests that verify the parallel and progress functionality
