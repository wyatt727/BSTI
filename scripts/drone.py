    Represents a remote drone used for SSH communication and file transfer.

    The class establishes an SSH connection upon instantiation if a connection doesn't already exist.
    It provides methods to download files from the drone, upload files to the drone, and execute commands on the drone.
    The class utilizes the `paramiko` library for SSH functionality.
    The connection is stored as a class attribute to allow reuse across instances.
