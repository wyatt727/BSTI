# BSTI Toolset

> **Original implementation by Connor Fancy**  
> This is a refactored version of the original BSTI toolset. Full credit for the original design and implementation goes to Connor Fancy.

## üìç Overview

The BSTI (Bulletproof SI) Toolset provides a suite of utilities designed to streamline and manage security assessment workflows, primarily focusing on Nessus vulnerability scanning and integration with Plextrac reporting. It combines functionalities for scan deployment, management, result processing, and reporting into a cohesive system.

The primary interface is now the refactored GUI application (`bsti_refactored.py`), offering a modular and user-friendly experience. Command-line tools and modules for specific tasks like Nessus management (`nmb.py`) and Nessus-to-Plextrac conversion (`bsti-nessus`) are also part of the toolset.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+ (check specific tool requirements if using older components directly)
*   Access to Nessus Scanner(s)
*   Access to a Plextrac instance (for conversion/upload features)
*   Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run platform-specific setup (if available/needed):**
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS
    chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

    # Windows
    .\install.bat
    ```
    *(Note: Check if `install.sh`/`.bat` scripts exist and are relevant for the combined toolset)*

### Basic Usage

#### Setting Up Drone Connections (New Feature)

The new drone configuration manager makes it easy to set up and reuse drone connections:

1. **Run the drone setup wizard:**
   ```bash
   python setup_drone.py --wizard
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts** to enter drone name, hostname/IP, username, and password.

3. **Use your saved drone** in any command by specifying just the name:
   ```bash
   python nmb.py -d your_drone_name -m test-connection
   ```

4. **Manage your drone configurations:**
   ```bash
   # List all configured drones
   python setup_drone.py --list
   
   # Test a drone connection
   python setup_drone.py --test your_drone_name
   
   # Delete a drone configuration
   python setup_drone.py --delete your_drone_name
   ```

#### Main GUI Application (Recommended)

1.  **Launch the application:**
    ```bash
    python bsti_refactored.py
    ```
2.  **Connect to a drone/scanner** using the connection options within the GUI.
3.  **Navigate through tabs** to access different features (Scan Management, Plextrac Export, etc.).

#### Plugin Manager (for Nessus-to-Plextrac)

Use the Plugin Manager to review and categorize Nessus findings before uploading to Plextrac.

1.  **Run interactively:**
    ```bash
    python bsti_refactored.py --plugin-manager
    ```
    *   Follow prompts to load a Nessus CSV and manage plugin categories.

2.  **Run via command-line actions:**
    ```bash
    # Example: Add specific plugin IDs to the 'SSH' category
    python bsti_refactored.py --plugin-manager --action add_plugin --category "SSH" --plugin-ids "10881,10862,90317"

    # Example: Write changes to the configuration
    python bsti_refactored.py --plugin-manager --action write_changes
    ```

#### Configuration Wizard

Run the wizard to configure connections and settings interactively:
```bash
# For NMB settings (if applicable)
python nmb.py --config-wizard

# For Nessus-to-Plextrac settings (if applicable)
bsti-nessus --config-wizard

# Check if bsti_refactored.py has its own wizard entry point
# python bsti_refactored.py --config-wizard (Example, verify command)
```

#### Command-Line Tools (Legacy/Specific Use)

While the GUI is recommended, individual tools might still be used:

*   **Nessus Management Buddy (NMB):**
    ```bash
    python nmb.py -m <MODE> [OPTIONS...]
    # Example: Deploy a scan
    python nmb.py -m deploy -d nessus.example.com -c client_project -s core --targets-file targets.txt
    ```
    *   Modes: `deploy`, `create`, `launch`, `pause`, `resume`, `monitor`, `export`, `external`, `internal`, `regen`

*   **BSTI Nessus-to-Plextrac Converter:**
    ```bash
    bsti-nessus [OPTIONS...]
    # Example: Convert and upload
    bsti-nessus -u user -p pass -d ./nessus_files -t plextrac_instance --client MyClient --report ReportName
    ```

## üîß Troubleshooting

*   **Safe Mode:** If the main GUI fails, try launching in safe mode:
    ```bash
    python bsti_refactored.py --safe-mode
    ```
*   **Dependencies:** Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed correctly in your Python environment.
*   **Configuration:** Verify that configuration files (e.g., `NMB_config.json`, `config/config.json`) exist and are correctly formatted.
*   **Permissions:** Check for necessary file system permissions (e.g., writing to temp directories, reading input files).
*   **Connectivity:** Ensure network connectivity to Nessus scanners and Plextrac instances.
