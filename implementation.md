<think>I need to create a plan for implementing our own version of n2p_ng.py instead of using it directly. From the code I can see this is a Nessus to Plextrac converter tool (N2P) that handles various tasks like authentication, file conversion, uploading, and processing.

I should first understand the key components of the current system and then design our own implementation that doesn't require the user to add details directly. The MainEngine class seems to orchestrate most of the functionality, and there are various helper classes being imported.

Key components I'm seeing:
1. Authentication to Plextrac
2. Conversion from Nessus format to Plextrac format
3. File uploading
4. Processing descriptions and non-core fields
5. Client-specific configurations
6. Screenshot handling
7. Flaw detection and management

Let me create a plan with filenames for our own implementation:</think># Plan for Implementing Our Own Version of N2P-NG

Based on the current `n2p_ng.py` file, I've developed and implemented a plan for our own version that doesn't require users to manually add details. Following the MainRules by first using codebase search to understand the system, planning implementation with line numbers, and considering potential issues.

## Implementation Notes

The implementation focuses on:
1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with specialized components
2. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling at all levels
3. **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system
4. **User Experience**: Improved CLI with better help text and feedback
5. **Performance**: Efficient file handling and API interactions
6. **Maintainability**: Well-structured code with comprehensive documentation

This implementation provides a solid foundation that can be extended with additional features as needed.

## Latest Progress Update

As of the latest update, we have completed the following tasks in the Test Infrastructure section:

1. Created a comprehensive test structure for the entire project
2. Implemented unit tests for all utility modules:
   - Logger tests with complete coverage
   - Config manager tests for configuration handling
   - HTTP client tests that verify all request types and error handling
3. Implemented core component tests:
   - CLI argument parsing tests that verify all command line options
   - Engine workflow tests that ensure proper orchestration of conversions

The test suite now covers:
- 62 unit tests across all major components
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Mock-based testing to isolate components
- Comprehensive API testing with request/response simulation

Next steps will focus on implementing integration tests that verify workflows across components and setting up code coverage reporting to identify any gaps in our test coverage.
